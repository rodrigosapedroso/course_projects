# Time Calculator

This is the second project from the **Scientific Computing with Python** course on freeCodeCamp.  

The program, add_time(), takes a starting time and a duration and calculates the new time. Optionally, it can also account for the day of the week and display the new day and how many days have passed.

## Example

**Input:**
```python
add_time("3:00 PM", "3:10")
# Expected: 6:10 PM

add_time("11:59 PM", "24:00", "Wednesday")
# Expected: 11:59 PM, Friday (2 days later)
```
**Output:**
```
6:10 PM
11:59 PM, Friday (2 days later)
```
