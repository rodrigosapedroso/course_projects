# Arithmetic Formatter

This is the first project from the **Scientific Computing with Python** course on freeCodeCamp.  
The program receives a list of arithmetic problems and formats them vertically. Optionally, it can also display the results.

## Example

**Input:**
```python
arithmetic_arranger(["32 + 698", "3801 - 2", "45 + 43", "123 + 49"], True)
```
**Output:**
```
   32      3801      45      123
+ 698    -    2    + 43    +  49
-----    ------    ----    -----
  730      3799      88      172
```
